# Aim and scope
1. Using hclust and/or MCL method to make the cluster for gene model tracks.
2. Make consensus of each gene model by cutting the dendrogram and get the node information.
3. Make plot using python or R package to visualize the consensus process.



### Reply on
1. pysam to parser the bamfile to gene model
3. bedtools for intersection
4. scipy for hclust function
5. matplotlib and pylab for plotting


## Optional
1. UCSC kent source tree (for generating binary track)
